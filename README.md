# gointreau
Repository with some stuff for a Go language intro

# Installing Go
Go can be acquired from https://golang.org. Binary distributions
are available for Windows, Mac and Linux:\
https://golang.org/dl/

# Getting started with Go
After running the installer, everything should be set up
to get started. All that's left is to set the GOPATH environment
variable and start coding! See:\
https://golang.org/doc/install#testing\
Note that the Go documentation recommends a certain directory stucture;
I am unsure whether that is to allow better tooling support or that it is
just a matter of recommended practice.

# Taking the Go tour
Go comes with a tour that takes you through the basics of the language.
It can be done online at:\
https://tour.golang.org/

Alternatively, once go is installed locally, the Tour can be started
from the command line using the command:\
go tool tour

This runs the Go tour on the local machine.

# Using Go in Visual Studio Code
There is a plug in for Visual Studio code that uses the Go tool ecosystem
to provide rich editing support. Follow the instructions below to install it:
